## Football-team-generator
create a tool which randomly divide two n-a-side football teams from a list of 10 players.

### How to set up
* NPM and a Command Line tool is needed.
* git clone this repo
* run npm install 
* run npm start to view on localhost:3000

### Tecnologies and skills used
React/Redux, JSX, JavaScript, HTML, CSS/SASS, Git, Wireframing.

### Initial ideation and planning
MVP : randomly picking a 5-a-sid football team from a list of 10 names.
Advanced feature can be : user to pick n-a-side, divide teams by players' position - stricker, Defender, Mid-fielder, Goal-keeper..

* Programming perspective: need to take user input -> store in an array -> divide into two arrays.
* UX perspective: don't confuss users of where to input information and what to do - provide clear guide and easy to use UI.
* UI perspective: mobile first design focused.
